Legacy code ported from `retroguard` under `LGPL` is compiled into a seperate archive called `retroguard-${VERSION}.jar`.

## Development

### Building

To build `yGuard` you will need `Java >= 7`.

Download the repository and build `yGuard` using `./gradlew build`.

The bundle version (for Ant users) is built using the `assembleBundleDist` task (e.g `./gradlew assembleBundleDist`).
The `assembleBundleDist` task comes with a optional parameter to copy documentation (`-Pcopy-docs`).

In order to build the documentation you will need [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/):

```
pip3 install mkdocs # or use a virtual environment if you prefer
mkdocs build
``` 

### Using IntellIJ with yGuard

`yGuard` will be loaded without further ado from `IntellIJ` thanks to the Gradle integration.
Opening the `yGuard` folder will set up Gradle and mark sources, tests and resources accordingly.
