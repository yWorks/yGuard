  <h1>Technical requirements</h1>
  <p>yGuard requires JDK 1.7.x or greater and Ant 1.5 or greater installed on
    your system.
    It may work with earlier versions of these pieces of software as well,
    however this has not
    been tested thoroughly. yGuard 1.3.x and upwards works together with Ant
    1.6.</p>
  <p></p>

  <a name="java11compat"></a>
  <h1>Java 11 Compatibility</h1>
  <p>
    Beginning with version 2.7, yGuard supports obfuscation of Java class files
    that contain <code>nesthost</code> or <code>nestmembers</code> attributes
    which were introduced with the Java 11 <code>.class</code> file format.
  </p>
  <p>
    yGuard does <b>not</b> support obfuscating <code>dynamic</code>
    instructions which were introduced with the Java 11 <code>.class</code> file
    format.
  </p>


  <a name="java9compat"></a>
  <h1>Java 9 / Java 10 Compatibility</h1>
  <p>
    Beginning with version 2.7, yGuard supports obfuscation of Java class files
    that contain module information which was introduced with the Java 9
    <code>.class</code> file format. yGuard does not change module names,
    though.
  </p>
  <p>
    yGuard does <b>not</b> support obfuscating multi-release Java archives which
    were introduced with Java 9.
  </p>


  <a name="java7compat"></a>
  <h1>Java 7 / Java 8 Compatibility</h1>

  <p>
    Beginning with version 2.5, yGuard supports obfuscation of Java class files
    that contain the <code>invokedynamic</code> instruction, which was
    introduced with the Java 7 <code>.class</code> file format.
    JDK 7 does not contain any means of issuing this instruction, with JDK 8 it
    is being issued when using lambda expressions or default methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    While yGuard does fully support obfuscating <code>invokedynamic</code>
    instructions and therefore default methods and lambda expressions,
    shrinking of Java class files that contain this instruction is not supported
    yet.
  </p>

      <code>ObfuscationAnnotation.jar</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.5 - Changes since 2.4.0.1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>

      Fixed a bug that caused yGuard to introduce invalid signatures for typed
      classes with inner classes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused yGuard to erroneously exclude all classes from

      <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> element without an additional <code>name</code>
      or <code>expose</code> attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused the shrinker to ignore the
      <code>&lt;attribute&gt;</code> element if the default shrinking settings
      were used (i.e. if no <code>&lt;keep&gt;</code> element was defined).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.3.0.1 - Changes since 2.3.0</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused the shrinker to remove the static initializer of
      a non-static inner class, when only fields of the inner class were

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.3.0 - Changes since 2.2.0</h2>

      "runtimeVisibleParameterAnnotations" etc. attributes of the
      <code>&lt;keep&gt;</code> element.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused the shrinker to remove the enclosing method of

  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.2.0 - Changes since 2.1.0</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>yGuard is now fully JDK-1.6 compatible.</li>
    <li>
      The yGuard task now supports a way of specifying a set of jars that
      should be obfuscated at the same time using simple patternset syntax.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard now uses the same technique for all elements in the MANIFEST file
      to adjust fully qualified class name strings.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is now possible to tell yGuard not to obfuscate specific package
      names.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard can now be given a list of digest algorithms that will be used to
      create the digests in the manifest.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard now issues a warning if the package or class or method name of a
      native method is obfuscated.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.1.0 - Changes since 2.0.3</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused yGuard to throw a NullPointerException if a
      <code>attribute</code> element contained no nested
      <code>patternset</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Fixed a bug that caused yGuard to use multiple logging instances if a
      yGuard task was executed multiple times.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed LineNumberTable and SourceFile elements</li>
    <li>Added overloadEnabled property</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.0.3 - Changes since 2.0.2</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that broke the nested <code>map</code> element of the
      <code>rename</code> element.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.0.2 - Changes since 2.0.1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused yGuard to fail during class file parsing if a
      method signature contained an inner class of a parameterized class.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard will not complain about the Java 1.5 attributes
      <code>Bridge</code>, <code>Enum</code> and <code>Varargs</code> as
      "unknown attributes" anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that caused all classnames to be kept from renaming if the
      <code>extends</code> attribute was used in combination with the
      <code>classes</code> attribute.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.0.1 - Changes since 2.0</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed an inconsistency between the interpretation of the Ant syntax in
      the <code>rename</code> and <code>shrink</code> elements. Now, both
      elements apply <code>patternset</code> elements in nested
      <code>method</code> and <code>field</code> elements to class names, just
      as stated in the yGuard documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <code>classes</code> attribute of the <code>class</code> element
      is not set or set to &quot;none&quot;, the shrinking engine will now
      include the classes that match based on the given <code>name</code>
      attribute or nested <code>patternset</code>, effectively ignoring the
      <code>classes</code> attribute.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 2.0 - Changes since 1.5.0_03</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>New elaborate code shrinking functionality.</li>
    <li>
      More powerful ant syntax: <code>extends</code>/<code>implements</code>
      attributes for the <code>class</code> element.
    </li>
    <li>
      General Ant syntax changes due to the introduction of the new
      <code>yguard</code>, <code>shrink</code> and <code>rename</code> elements.
    </li>
    <li>yGuard now needs Java2 SDK 1.4.x or greater to function properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.5.0_03 - Changes since 1.5.0_02</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed bad treatment of the new enclosing method feature in Tiger which
      sometimes led to AbstractMethodErrors at runtime.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.5.0_02 - Changes since 1.5.0_01</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improved obfuscation logic for enumerations. Now the two static methods
      valueOf(String) and values() don't have to be exposed manually anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed bad annotation handling for non-trivial annotations. Annotations had
      not been parsed and handled correctly, which could lead to either
      errors during obfuscation or Errors at runtime.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.5.0_01 - Changes since 1.5</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug that made yGuard ignore some of the attributes in the expose
      section ("sourcefile" and "linenumbertable").
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a rare but severe bug that accidentally removed method attributes
      and sometimes led to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions during the
      obfuscation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.5 - Changes since 1.3.2</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added JDK 1.5 (a.k.a Java 5.0 code-named Tiger) compatibility.
      yGuard can now deal correctly with the new JDK and Java features:
      generics, var-args, enumerations, annotations, new "<code>.class</code>"
      bytecode construct, signatures, local variable type table, enclosing
      method information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented the ability to obfuscate/scramble/shrink line number
      information. This makes it possible to more easily debug stacktraces
      without exposing line number information in the obfuscated version of the
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented the ability to obfuscate the source file information. This is
      necessary in order to view line number information in stack traces. It is
      now possible to reassign the source file attribute inside class files so
      that the original source file name is not exposed in the obfuscated
      application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added the ability to determine on a per-class basis what attributes to
      expose or obfuscate. This includes line number information (with optional
      scrambling/compression or removal), source file attributes, deprecation
      attributes, etc.
      This makes it easy to obfuscate parts of your application while keeping
      the public API untouched and debug information for third party jars
      intact.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved the stacktrace deobfuscation tool. It can now unscramble line
      number information from stacktraces, features a more polished view of the
      mapping rules and deobfuscates stacktraces more reliably if the
      stacktraces are ambiguous.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.3.2 - Changes since 1.3.1_01</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improved name generation. yGuard will now generate legal identifiers
      (with respect to <code>Character.isJavaIdentifierStart()</code>
      and <code>Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(char)</code> and
      <code>Character.isIdentifierIgnorable(char)</code>) and should
      therefor produce jars that should verify correctly even on older jdks
      if yGuard is run using newer jdks.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard now helps in the detection of duplicate class files in source jars.
      In pedantic mode yGuard will terminate if duplicate classes are detected
      in different source jars. yGuard's obfuscate task will always fail if
      mutliple class files containing a definition for the same jar are
      detected. The log file displays useful information for finding the
      duplicate entries.
    </li>
    <li>Improved xml log file output for Unicode characters.</li>
    <li>
      Made the log file viewer output more consistent with inner class names
      that were being mapped during obfuscation versus those who remained fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Jar file entries are now being sorted prior to being written to the jar.
    </li>
    <li>Improved handling of external classes.</li>
    <li>
      Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed a name clash problem that occurred when already obfuscated code
          was being obfuscated again using different settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed a resolution problem concerning interfaces from external
          classpaths.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.3.1_01 - Changes since 1.3.1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      yGuard now treats the COMPATIBLE flag for the language conformity
      different.
      Field names and class names are now made up of lower ascii-only chars.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed a problem concerning the <code>adjust</code> elements throwing
          a <code>RuntimeException</code> in the pattern matching code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed a problem where the wrong set of files was affected in the
          <code>adjust</code> section.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.3.1 - Changes since 1.3</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>yGuard will now generate (empty) directory entries in the resulting jar
      files for each non-empty directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved the optional keeping of "Deprecated" tags. Somehow they still
      seem to get lost under certain conditions.
      Any feedback on this topic is welcomed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Due to a compile time dependency, yGuard could not be used with jdk 1.3.x
      anymore even if the automatic resource adjustment feature was not used.
      This has now been made possible again.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed a rare problem that broke obfuscated code using static method
          invocations and static field references.
        </li>
        <li>
          There was a bug in the log file viewer (<code>java -jar yguard.jar
          [logfile.xml[.gz]]</code>) that made it crash under very rare
          circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented a workaround for an Ant incompatibility problem, which
          resulted in yGuard behaving differently on different platforms and in
          conjunction with different Ant versions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.3 - Changes since 1.2</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added automatic text file and property file renaming mechanism. yGuard can
      now be configured to rename .properties files according to the
      obfuscation.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is now possible to process text files and replace occurances
      of class names with their obfuscated versions.
    </li>
    <li>
      One can now specify whether resource files should be kept in their
      original directory while at the same time the classes residing in the
      respective directory can be fully obfuscated to another package.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard can now automatically create gzipped (.gz) logfiles and work
      directly on compressed logfiles. This reduces the size of the logfiles
      drastically.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is now possible to simply specify a list of attributes, that should not
      be removed by yGuard (for example "<code>Deprecated</code>") using the
      <code>expose-attributes</code> property.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard has a new name generation method (<code>language-conformity</code>
      = <code>compatible</code>), that creates jar file that <b>can</b> be
      successfully unzipped to the windows filesystem.
    </li>
    <li>
      In order to avoid namespace clashes, on can now easily specify a prefix
      for completeley obfuscated package hierarchies using the
      <code>obfuscation-prefix</code> property.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enhanced documentation (DTD, examples, and new features description).
    </li>
    <li>
      Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Innerclasses making use of the .class construct should now always be
          correctly obfuscated using the replaceClassNameStrings feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>patch</code> element had a bug concerning field name
          mappings, which is now resolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          yGuard now tests whether a newly obfuscated name already exists in
          external jars and automatically generates names, that should not
          clash.
        </li>
        <li>yGuard should now work together with Ant version 1.6 (there was an
          undocumented change in the API of Ant).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.2 - Changes since 1.1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added support for external libraries. This allows yGuard to obfuscate
      jars that have external dependencies more easily and using stronger
      obfuscation. It is now possible to specify dependencies using Ant
      classpath
      elements. yGuard then uses information found in these jars to resolve
      external dependencies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved error handling and task and logfile output. yGuard will now
      produce
      fewer unreasonable warnings. During the obfuscation run yGuard will give
      more detailed warnings and hints when unobfuscatable classes are detected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added property <code>error-checking</code> which can be set to
      <code>pedantic</code>. In this case yGuard will not issue warnings but a
      build will fail instead of issueing simple warnings. This helps in finding
      problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a minor issue. The documentation stated, that
      <pre>&lt;class classes="protected"/></pre>
      behaved like
      <pre>&lt;class classes="protected">
  &lt;patternset>
    &lt;include name="**.*"/>
  &lt;/patternset>
&lt;/class></pre>
      but in the implementation <code>&lt;include name="*"/></code>
      had been applied. This has now been fixed to <code>&lt;include
      name="**.*"/></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed some bugs in the documentation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>yGuard 1.1 - Changes since 1.0.1</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added support for different naming schemes. These schemes result in
      smaller
      jar files, better obfuscation and lead to jar files,
      which cannot be unpacked to normal filesystems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed two JBuilder incompatibilities. Innerclasses created by JBuilder do
      not prevent yGuard from working anymore and (correct) innerclasses created
      by yGuard do not crash JBuilder anymore (which btw. is a bug in JB).
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented a fix for the problem, where the <code>ClassName.class</code>
      code construct prevented classes from being obfuscated entirely.
    </li>
    <li>
      yGuard can now automatically obfuscate code of the form <code>
      Class.forName("com.mycompany.myapp.MyClass");
    </code> so that these classes can now be obfuscated by name, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved the serialization of the obfuscation map to the xml file, which
      can
      now be parsed back in by the included tool even for complicated naming
      schemes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Refactored the creation of the final jar files. The current implementation
      leads to more standard conform jar files.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed two bugs concerning the handling of manifest files.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug concerning the handling of the Main-Class attribute of
      manifest
      files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes since 1.0</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Implemented more robust handling of Manifest files. Implementation now
      makes
      use of java.util.jar.Manifest.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Main-Class attribute of the Manifest files will now be translated to
      the
      obfuscated name, if the main class is not exposed.
    </li>
    <li>
      The conserveManifest attribute of the obfuscate task now conserves the
      manifest in a better way.
    </li>
  </ul>
